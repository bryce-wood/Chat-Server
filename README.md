<ins>__Step 1__</ins>: Run server.py on whatever system you wish to host the chat.
- Keep note of the IP it prints to console as that is what you will be connecting to.

<ins>__Step 2__</ins>: Run client.py on each system you want to chat on and enter the questions in console, make sure that the IP you enter for "Enter the chatroom's IP address:" matches the ip address of the computer running server.py

<ins>__Step 3__</ins>: Start chatting! Anyone can connect to the chatroom if they have the IP address of the host running server.py

- If you want a one on one chat, don't let anyone else know the IP address of the host running server.py
- If you want a group chat, let as many people as you want know IP address of the host running server.py
