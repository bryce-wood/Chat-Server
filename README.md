Step 1: Run server.py on whatever system you wish to host the chat.
        *Keep note of the IP it prints to console as that is what you will be connecting to.

Step 2: Run client.py on each system you want to chat on and enter the questions in console, make sure that the IP you enter for "Enter the chatroom's IP address:" matches the ip address of the computer running server.py

Step 3: Start chatting! Anyone can connect to the chatroom if they have the IP address of the host running server.py



If you want a one on one chat, don't let anyone else know the IP address of the host running server.py
If you want a group chat, let as many people as you want know IP address of the host running server.py
