<ins>__Step 1__</ins>: Run _server.py_ on whatever system you wish to host the chat.
- Keep note of the IP it prints to console as that is what you will be connecting to.

<ins>__Step 2__</ins>: Run _client.py_ on each system you want to chat on and enter the questions in console, make sure that the IP you enter for "Enter the chatroom's IP address:" matches the ip address of the computer running _server.py_

<ins>__Step 3__</ins>: Start chatting! Anyone can connect to the chatroom if they have the IP address of the host running _server.py_

- If you want a one on one chat, don't let anyone else know the IP address of the host running _server.py_
- If you want a group chat, let as many people as you want know IP address of the host running _server.py_
